## Osaka

Osaka saved places - https://maps.app.goo.gl/MLjabhYhvf5BPvVG7

**Arrival Day**

We flew with British Airways from London Heathrow and had a beautiful view of the famous Mt Fuji upon entering Japan. After exiting the airport, we headed to the Japan Rail Pass office to get our rail passes. Then, we picked up our welcome Suica cards at the travel card counter, putting about 1000 yen on each card. At the JPR counter, they booked us on the Shinkansen to Osaka. It's important to reserve your spot as it can be quite busy.

Upon arrival, we headed to our hotel, [Osaka Guest House U-En, Osaka](https://www.u-en.jp/?lang=en). This hostel provided a private room that was extremely clean (like everywhere in Japan). We highly recommend it if you're on a budget. We spent £150.00 for 5 nights—this is not a typo.

We then headed to Shitennoji Temple (one of the oldest temples in Japan). Shitennoji was a short walk from Shitennoji-mae Yuhigaoka Station on the Tanimachi Subway Line, but we could have also got the JR Osaka Loop Line (free woith the JR Pass) which would have been a ten-minute walk north of Tennoji Station.

**Day 2**

Today was a big cultural day for us as we did an Onsen. We were super nervous, we didnt know whether to take our kit of or not, so we hovered around trying to see what others were doing..

Overall, once you realised everyone was butt naked it was totally fine, the view was beautiful (not the nakedness, it geniunly went out onto a beautiful japanese garden. It was split into a boy and girl only areas and the fact no one spoke a word of english, really helped the experience and made it a little less daunting. We went to Solaniwa Onsen and found the whole experience relaxing. We got there via riding the Osaka Loop Line from Fukushima Station to Bentencho Station. We prenbooked our tickets on booking.com. The day was concluded with a beautiful walk round the teamLab Botanical Garden Osaka. 

**Day 3**
Today we explored the american mura, Dotombori in the day, Doguyasuji Arcade, Namba Marui and Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Arcade. 

We had food at the Katsudon Chiyomatsu | Dotonbori Main Store resturant, we had heard that it was the best katsudon in Osaka, we heard correctly, we qued for ages but oh my, it was good. 

Doguyasuji Arcade is Osaka’s kitchen and restaurant supply street, you name it, they have it. We got some gorgeous gifts to bring home. Namba Marui (shopping mall) was nice, but we didnt see anything that made us think WOW. 
  
**Day 4**

We ventured to 
 Nara Deer Park: The trip from Osaka is covered by the JR Pass. Take the Yamatoji Line from either JR Osaka Station or Tennoji Station to JR Nara Station. The trip takes 30 to 45 minutes one-way, depending on the departing station. The Nara Deer Park is open 24 hours a day. Admission is free, but you will most likely wish to purchase deer crackers during your visit. A pack of ten crackers costs 150 yen.
- Tobita Shinchi “red light district” evening 5pm onwards. Ride the OLL from Fukushima Station to Shin Imamiya Station, then walk 16 minutes to the red-light district and bar call me tell me. 


- Dotombori: For colors, crowds, and consumerism, you can’t beat Dotombori, Osaka’s most popular shopping, entertainment, nightlife, and culinary destination. If you’re visiting the city, you shouldn’t miss this place. Subway and Train: 2-minute walk from exit 14 of Namba Station.
- Hozenji Yokocho: A beautiful alley in Osaka with more than 60 traditional and restored shops and restaurants, Hozenji Yokocho looks like it was transported from Kyoto. Entering this street is like slipping 200 years back in time, especially when it is lit by lanterns in the evening. The street is named for Hozen-ji Temple, which is home to the fascinating Mizu-kake Fudo, an image of the Buddhist deity Fudo, the kami of fury. Covered in a lush coat of moss, this is an unusual and beautiful sight not to be missed.

**Day 5 Hiroshima Day Trip**
- Travel time: Between 1 hour and 30 minutes to 3 hours
- Cost: Covered by JR Pass
- The Sanyo Shinkansen Line provides fast and convenient access between Osaka and Hiroshima. Its Sakura and Hikari trains can take you from Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka to Hiroshima Station in about an hour and a half, and its Kodama trains take about 2 hours and a half. With your JR Pass, you can board any of the three trains without extra fees.
- Atomic Bomb Dome
- Peace Memorial Park – Hiroshima
- Hiroshima is a dynamic city with many attractions besides the atomic bomb memorials. Popular attractions include Hiroshima Castle (Carp Castle) and Shukkeien Garden. It’s also fun to walk around, shop, and sample local cuisine.

### Day 6
- Osaka Castle: Head to Osaka Castle at 8:30 am. Leave Osaka Castle by 10:30 am.

-  Den-Den Town (electronics shopping district): Osaka’s answer to Tokyo’s Akihabara, Den-Den is the city’s electronics, camera, computer, and pop culture shopping neighborhood. It’s about 10 minutes’ walk southwest of Namba Station, in Nippombashi, running roughly between Nippombashi and Ebisucho stations on the Sakaisuji subway line. Many of the shops have someone on hand who can speak English, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.
