## Osaka

### Arrival Day
We flew with British Airways from London Heathrow and we had a beautiful view on entering the country of the famous Mt Fuji. Upon exiting the airport we headed to the Japan Rail Pass office and got our rail passes*, before heading to the travel card counter, where we got our welcome Suica, you must have one each and we put about 1000 yen on each. At the JPR counter they booked us on the Shinkasen and we headed to Osaka, you must reserve your spot as we thought this was really busy. 

Upon arrival we headed to our hotel which was called the *Osaka Guest House U-En, Osaka, Fukushima-ku Fukushima 2-9-23*. This place was a hostel but we had a private room and to be honest it was so clean (like everywhere in Japan) and we would defiantly reccomend if you are on a budget, we spent £150.00 for 5 nights - this is not a typo.
