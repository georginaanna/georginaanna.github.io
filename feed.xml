After exiting the airport, we headed to the Japan Rail Pass office to get our rail passes. Then, we picked up our welcome Suica cards at the travel card counter, putting about 1000 yen on each card. At the JPR counter, they booked us on the Shinkansen to Osaka. It’s important to reserve your spot as it can be quite busy.</p> <p>Upon arrival, we headed to our hotel, <a href="https://www.u-en.jp/?lang=en">Osaka Guest House U-En, Osaka</a>. This hostel provided a private room that was extremely clean (like everywhere in Japan). We highly recommend it if you’re on a budget. We spent £150.00 for 5 nights—this is not a typo.</p> <p>We then headed to Shitennoji Temple (one of the oldest temples in Japan). Shitennoji was a short walk from Shitennoji-mae Yuhigaoka Station on the Tanimachi Subway Line, but we could have also taken the JR Osaka Loop Line (free with the JR Pass), which would have been a ten-minute walk north of Tennoji Station.</p> <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p> <p>Today was a big cultural day for us as we did an Onsen. We were super nervous; we didn’t know whether to take our kit off or not, so we hovered around trying to see what others were doing.</p> <p>Overall, once we realized everyone was butt naked, it was totally fine. The view was beautiful (not the nakedness; it genuinely looked out onto a beautiful Japanese garden). It was split into boy and girl-only areas, and the fact no one spoke a word of English really helped the experience and made it a little less daunting. We went to Solaniwa Onsen and found the whole experience relaxing. We got there via the Osaka Loop Line from Fukushima Station to Bentencho Station. We pre-booked our tickets on booking.com. The day was concluded with a beautiful walk around the teamLab Botanical Garden Osaka.</p> <p><strong>Day 3</strong></p> <p>Today we explored American Mura, Dotombori in the day, Doguyasuji Arcade, Namba Marui, and Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Arcade.</p> <p>We had traditional Japanese sweets and matcha tea at WAD Tea Room; we would certainly recommend this experience.</p> <p>Doguyasuji Arcade is Osaka’s kitchen and restaurant supply street. You name it, they have it. We got some gorgeous gifts to bring home. Namba Marui (shopping mall) was nice, but we didn’t see anything that made us think WOW.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>We had food at the Katsudon Chiyomatsu</td> <td>Dotonbori Main Store restaurant. We had heard that it was the best katsudon in Osaka, and we heard correctly. We queued for ages, but oh my, it was good.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pommier-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pommier-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pommier-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/pommier.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/barcallmetellme-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/barcallmetellme-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/barcallmetellme-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/barcallmetellme.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pancake-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pancake-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pancake-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/pancake.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bean-paste-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bean-paste-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bean-paste-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bean-paste.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/starbucks-treats-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/starbucks-treats-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/starbucks-treats-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/starbucks-treats.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <p><strong>Day 4</strong></p> <p>We ventured to Nara Deer Park for a little day trip. It was cute, and we probably spent about two hours there. The trip from Osaka is covered by the JR Pass. The trip takes 30 to 45 minutes one way, depending on the departing station. The Nara Deer Park is open 24 hours a day. Admission is free.</p> <p>We then explored the Tobita Shinchi “red light district” from 5 pm onwards. Then we went to a bar called Me Tell Me (the telephone box place) and had a 7-Eleven smoothie, and yes, it is just like the TikToks! Probably the best convenience store ever.</p> <p><strong>Day 5 - Hiroshima Day Trip</strong></p> <p>As we only had the 7-day JR Pass, we needed to make the most of it, so we headed out to Hiroshima. We bought half the food in the station for the trip and basically snacked all day. When we arrived, there was a super convenient bus that takes you to all the different places. We visited the Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park, Hiroshima Castle (Carp Castle), and Shukkeien Garden.</p> <p>This evening we had a chilled one and went for some ramen at the Ressishoyu Menkobo Sanku. This was recommended by the lady in the guest house. It was only a few minutes’ walk from where we were staying, and it was DELICIOUS.</p> <p><strong>Day 6</strong></p> <p>We slept in this morning and then basically had curry for breakfast at Pommier restaurant. This was another highly recommended food place, and it delivered. We then explored Den-Den Town (electronics shopping district). We grabbed some drinks and then went to Dotombori for the local cuisine: a cheese coin, a custard coin, meat skewers, and some takoyaki.</p> <h2 id="kyoto">Kyoto</h2> <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AoHZQuVgUMJxGmS66">Kyoto saved places</a></p> <p><strong>Day 7</strong></p> <p>We left Osaka pretty early as we wanted to make the most of the day in Kyoto.</p> <p>We stored our baggage at Kyoto Station, it was cheap and cheerful, we paid 700 yen for a big suitcase each per day, using our Suica cards).We then headed out for a big day of sight seeing, and another Onsen, mainly because we found the first onso relaxing, as lets not lie, this kind of holiday is not in any way shape or form, a relaxing one. We headed to the Bamboo Forest, followed by Tenryu-ji (temple), we wandered across Togetsukyo Bridge before heading to Fu-fu-no-yu Onsen.</p> <p>We then headed back to our hotel, which was LUXURIOUS in comparison to the hostel we stayed at previously. Never underestimate a decent matresse. We stayed at</p> <p>On the evening we headed to see the Yasaka Shrine and walk around the Gion District, we had drinks on the rooftop bar of The Hotel Seiryu Kyoto Kiyomizu which gave us a beautiful view of the gion district.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pommier-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pommier-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pommier-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/pommier.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null;
