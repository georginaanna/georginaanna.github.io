Understanding data (well at least trying to keep up with all the new tools) has opened a massive door of oppertunity and thought. The potential within all aspects of life is vast and this is really empowering and exciting. I have a BSc (Hons) Agriculture and an MSc in Data Science for Global Agriculture, Food and Environment. My skills were then put to use as a Data Scientist at Harper, where I was involved in the Tuberscan project that utilises deep learning and data science to improve agronomy decisions in the potato industry. 

I am involved in statistics, computer vision, machine learning, agriculture and economics. My next adventure is to complete my PhD which is focused on understanding the Economics of Precision Livestock Farming.
